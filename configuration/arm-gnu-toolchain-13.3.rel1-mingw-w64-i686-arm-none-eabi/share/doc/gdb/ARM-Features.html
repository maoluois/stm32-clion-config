<span id="ARM-Features-1"></span><h4 class="subsection">G.5.3 ARM Features</h4>
<span id="index-target-descriptions_002c-ARM-features"></span>

<span id="Core-register-set-for-non_002dM_002dprofile"></span><h4 class="subsubsection">G.5.3.1 Core register set for non-M-profile</h4>

<p>The &lsquo;<samp>org.gnu.gdb.arm.core</samp>&rsquo; feature is required for non-M-profile
ARM targets. It must contain the following registers:
</p>
<ul class="no-bullet">
<li>- &lsquo;<samp>r0</samp>&rsquo; through &lsquo;<samp>r12</samp>&rsquo;.  The general purpose registers.  They are 32 bits
in size and have a type of &lsquo;<samp>uint32</samp>&rsquo;.
</li><li>- &lsquo;<samp>sp</samp>&rsquo;, the stack pointer register, also known as &lsquo;<samp>r13</samp>&rsquo;.  It is 32 bits
in size and has a type of &lsquo;<samp>data_ptr</samp>&rsquo;.
</li><li>- &lsquo;<samp>lr</samp>&rsquo;, the link register.  It is 32 bits in size.
</li><li>- &lsquo;<samp>pc</samp>&rsquo;, the program counter register.  It is 32 bit in size and of type
&lsquo;<samp>code_ptr</samp>&rsquo;.
</li><li>- &lsquo;<samp>cpsr</samp>&rsquo;, the current program status register containing all the status
bits.  It is 32 bits in size.  Historically this register was hardwired to
number 25, but debugging stubs that report XML do not need to use this number
anymore.
</li></ul>

<p>Extra registers are allowed in this feature, but they will not affect
<small>GDB</small>.
</p>
<span id="Core-register-set-for-M_002dprofile"></span><h4 class="subsubsection">G.5.3.2 Core register set for M-profile</h4>

<p>For M-profile targets (e.g. Cortex-M3), the &lsquo;<samp>org.gnu.gdb.arm.core</samp>&rsquo;
feature is replaced by &lsquo;<samp>org.gnu.gdb.arm.m-profile</samp>&rsquo;, and it is a required
feature.  It must contain the following registers:
</p>
<ul class="no-bullet">
<li>- &lsquo;<samp>r0</samp>&rsquo; through &lsquo;<samp>r12</samp>&rsquo;, the general purpose registers.  They have a size
of 32 bits and a type of &lsquo;<samp>uint32</samp>&rsquo;.
</li><li>- &lsquo;<samp>sp</samp>&rsquo;, the stack pointer register, also known as &lsquo;<samp>r13</samp>&rsquo;.  It has a size
of 32 bits and a type of &lsquo;<samp>data_ptr</samp>&rsquo;.
</li><li>- &lsquo;<samp>lr</samp>&rsquo;, the link register.  It has a size of 32 bits.
</li><li>- &lsquo;<samp>pc</samp>&rsquo;, the program counter register.  It has a size of 32 bits and a type
of &lsquo;<samp>code_ptr</samp>&rsquo;.
</li><li>- &lsquo;<samp>xpsr</samp>&rsquo;, the program status register containing all the status
bits.  It has a size of 32 bits.  Historically this register was hardwired to
number 25, but debugging stubs that report XML do not need to use this number
anymore.
</li></ul>

<p>Upon seeing this feature, <small>GDB</small> will acknowledge that it is dealing
with an M-profile target.  This means <small>GDB</small> will use hooks and
configurations that are meaningful to M-profiles.
</p>
<p>Extra registers are allowed in this feature, but they will not affect
<small>GDB</small>.
</p>
<span id="FPA-registers-feature-_0028obsolete_0029"></span><h4 class="subsubsection">G.5.3.3 FPA registers feature (obsolete)</h4>

<p>The &lsquo;<samp>org.gnu.gdb.arm.fpa</samp>&rsquo; feature is obsolete and should not be
advertised by debugging stubs anymore.  It used to advertise registers for
the old FPA architecture that has long been discontinued in toolchains.
</p>
<p>It is kept in <small>GDB</small> for backward compatibility purposes so older
debugging stubs that don&rsquo;t support XML target descriptions still work
correctly.  One such example is the KGDB debugging stub from
Linux or BSD kernels.
</p>
<p>The description below is for historical purposes only.  This feature
used to contain the following registers:
</p>
<ul class="no-bullet">
<li>- &lsquo;<samp>f0</samp>&rsquo; through &lsquo;<samp>f8</samp>&rsquo;.  The floating point registers.  They are 96 bits
in size and of type &lsquo;<samp>arm_fpa_ext</samp>&rsquo;.  &lsquo;<samp>f0</samp>&rsquo; is pinned to register
number 16.
</li><li>- &lsquo;<samp>fps</samp>&rsquo;, the status register.  It has a size of 32 bits.
</li></ul>

<span id="M_002dprofile-Vector-Extension-_0028MVE_0029"></span><h4 class="subsubsection">G.5.3.4 M-profile Vector Extension (MVE)</h4>

<p>Also known as Helium, the M-profile Vector Extension is advertised via the
optional &lsquo;<samp>org.gnu.gdb.arm.m-profile-mve</samp>&rsquo; feature.
</p>
<p>It must contain the following:
</p>
<ul class="no-bullet">
<li>- &lsquo;<samp>vpr</samp>&rsquo;, the vector predication status and control register.  It is 32 bits
in size and has a custom flags type.  The flags type is laid out in a way that
exposes the &lsquo;<samp>P0</samp>&rsquo; field from bits 0 to 15, the &lsquo;<samp>MASK01</samp>&rsquo; field from
bits 16 to 19 and the &lsquo;<samp>MASK23</samp>&rsquo; field from bits 20 to 23.

<p>Bits 24 through 31 are reserved.
</p></li></ul>

<p>When this feature is available, <small>GDB</small> will synthesize the &lsquo;<samp>p0</samp>&rsquo;
pseudo-register from &lsquo;<samp>vpr</samp>&rsquo; contents.
</p>
<p>This feature must only be advertised if the target is M-profile.  Advertising
this feature for targets that are not M-profile may cause <small>GDB</small> to
assume the target is M-profile when it isn&rsquo;t.
</p>
<p>If the &lsquo;<samp>org.gnu.gdb.arm.vfp</samp>&rsquo; feature is available alongside the
&lsquo;<samp>org.gnu.gdb.arm.m-profile-mve</samp>&rsquo; feature, <small>GDB</small> will
synthesize the &lsquo;<samp>q</samp>&rsquo; pseudo-registers from &lsquo;<samp>d</samp>&rsquo; register
contents.
</p>
<p>Extra registers are allowed in this feature, but they will not affect
<small>GDB</small>.
</p>
<span id="XScale-iwMMXt-feature"></span><h4 class="subsubsection">G.5.3.5 XScale iwMMXt feature</h4>

<p>The XScale &lsquo;<samp>org.gnu.gdb.xscale.iwmmxt</samp>&rsquo; feature is optional.  If present,
it must contain the following:
</p>
<ul class="no-bullet">
<li>- &lsquo;<samp>wR0</samp>&rsquo; through &lsquo;<samp>wR15</samp>&rsquo;, registers with size 64 bits and a custom type
&lsquo;<samp>iwmmxt_vec64i</samp>&rsquo;.  &lsquo;<samp>iwmmxt_vec64i</samp>&rsquo; is a union of four other
types: &lsquo;<samp>uint64</samp>&rsquo;, a 2-element vector of &lsquo;<samp>uint32</samp>&rsquo;, a 4-element
vector of &lsquo;<samp>uint16</samp>&rsquo; and a 8-element vector of &lsquo;<samp>uint8</samp>&rsquo;.
</li><li>- &lsquo;<samp>wCGR0</samp>&rsquo; through &lsquo;<samp>wCGR3</samp>&rsquo;, registers with size 32 bits and
type &lsquo;<samp>int</samp>&rsquo;.
</li></ul>

<p>The following registers are optional:
</p>
<ul class="no-bullet">
<li>- &lsquo;<samp>wCID</samp>&rsquo;, register with size of 32 bits and type &lsquo;<samp>int</samp>&rsquo;.
</li><li>- &lsquo;<samp>wCon</samp>&rsquo;, register with size 32 bits and type &lsquo;<samp>int</samp>&rsquo;.
</li><li>- &lsquo;<samp>wCSSF</samp>&rsquo;, register with size 32 bits and type &lsquo;<samp>int</samp>&rsquo;.
</li><li>- &lsquo;<samp>wCASF</samp>&rsquo;, register with size 32 bit and type &lsquo;<samp>int</samp>&rsquo;.
</li></ul>

<p>This feature should only be reported if the target is XScale.
</p>
<p>Extra registers are allowed in this feature, but they will not affect
<small>GDB</small>.
</p>
<span id="Vector-Floating_002dPoint-_0028VFP_0029-feature"></span><h4 class="subsubsection">G.5.3.6 Vector Floating-Point (VFP) feature</h4>

<p>The &lsquo;<samp>org.gnu.gdb.arm.vfp</samp>&rsquo; feature is optional.  If present, it
should contain one of two possible sets of values depending on whether
VFP version 2 or VFP version 3 is in use.
</p>
<p>For VFP v2:
</p>
<ul class="no-bullet">
<li>- &lsquo;<samp>d0</samp>&rsquo; through &lsquo;<samp>d15</samp>&rsquo;.  The double-precision registers.  They are
64 bits in size and have type &lsquo;<samp>ieee_double</samp>&rsquo;.
</li><li>- &lsquo;<samp>fpscr</samp>&rsquo;, the floating-point status and control register.  It has a size
of 32 bits and a type of &lsquo;<samp>int</samp>&rsquo;.
</li></ul>

<p>For VFP v3:
</p>
<ul class="no-bullet">
<li>- &lsquo;<samp>d0</samp>&rsquo; through &lsquo;<samp>d31</samp>&rsquo;.  The double-precision registers.  They are
64 bits in size and have type &lsquo;<samp>ieee_double</samp>&rsquo;.
</li><li>- &lsquo;<samp>fpscr</samp>&rsquo;, the floating-point status and control register.  It has a size
of 32 bits and a type of &lsquo;<samp>int</samp>&rsquo;.
</li></ul>

<p>If this feature is available, <small>GDB</small> will synthesize the
single-precision floating-point registers from halves of the double-precision
registers as pseudo-registers.
</p>
<p>Extra registers are allowed in this feature, but they will not affect
<small>GDB</small>.
</p>
<span id="NEON-architecture-feature"></span><h4 class="subsubsection">G.5.3.7 NEON architecture feature</h4>

<p>The &lsquo;<samp>org.gnu.gdb.arm.neon</samp>&rsquo; feature is optional.  It does not
need to contain registers; it instructs <small>GDB</small> to display the
VFP double-precision registers as vectors and to synthesize the
quad-precision registers from pairs of double-precision registers.
If this feature is present, &lsquo;<samp>org.gnu.gdb.arm.vfp</samp>&rsquo; must also
be present and include 32 double-precision registers.
</p>
<p>Extra registers are allowed in this feature, but they will not affect
<small>GDB</small>.
</p>
<span id="M_002dprofile-Pointer-Authentication-and-Branch-Target-Identification-feature"></span><h4 class="subsubsection">G.5.3.8 M-profile Pointer Authentication and Branch Target Identification feature</h4>

<p>The &lsquo;<samp>org.gnu.gdb.arm.m-profile-pacbti</samp>&rsquo; feature is optional, and
acknowledges support for the ARMv8.1-m PACBTI extensions.
</p>
<p>This feature doesn&rsquo;t contain any required registers, and it only serves as a
hint to <small>GDB</small> that the debugging stub supports the ARMv8.1-m PACBTI
extensions.
</p>
<p>When <small>GDB</small> sees this feature, it will track return address signing
states and will decorate backtraces using the [PAC] marker, similar to
AArch64&rsquo;s PAC extension.
See <a href="AArch64.html#AArch64-PAC">AArch64 PAC</a>.
</p>
<p>Extra registers are allowed in this feature, but they will not affect
<small>GDB</small>.
</p>
<span id="M_002dprofile-system-registers-feature"></span><h4 class="subsubsection">G.5.3.9 M-profile system registers feature</h4>

<p>The &lsquo;<samp>org.gnu.gdb.arm.m-system</samp>&rsquo; optional feature was introduced as a way to
inform <small>GDB</small> about additional system registers.
</p>
<p>At the moment this feature must contain the following:
</p>
<ul class="no-bullet">
<li>- &lsquo;<samp>msp</samp>&rsquo;, the main stack pointer register.  It is 32 bits in size with
type &lsquo;<samp>data_ptr</samp>&rsquo;.
</li><li>- &lsquo;<samp>psp</samp>&rsquo;, the process stack pointer register.  It is 32 bits in size with
type &lsquo;<samp>data_ptr</samp>&rsquo;.
</li></ul>

<p>This feature must only be advertised for M-profile targets.  When <small>GDB</small>
sees this feature, it will attempt to track the values of &lsquo;<samp>msp</samp>&rsquo; and
&lsquo;<samp>psp</samp>&rsquo; across frames.
</p>
<p>Extra registers are allowed in this feature, but they will not affect
<small>GDB</small>.
</p>
<span id="M_002dprofile-Security-Extensions-feature"></span><h4 class="subsubsection">G.5.3.10 M-profile Security Extensions feature</h4>

<p>The &lsquo;<samp>org.gnu.gdb.arm.secext</samp>&rsquo; optional feature was introduced so
<small>GDB</small> could better support the switching of stack pointers and
secure states in the Security Extensions.
</p>
<p>At the moment this feature must contain the following:
</p>
<ul class="no-bullet">
<li>- &lsquo;<samp>msp_ns</samp>&rsquo;, the main stack pointer register (non-secure state).  It is
32 bits in size with type &lsquo;<samp>data_ptr</samp>&rsquo;.
</li><li>- &lsquo;<samp>psp_ns</samp>&rsquo;, the process stack pointer register (non-secure state).  It is
32 bits in size with type &lsquo;<samp>data_ptr</samp>&rsquo;.
</li><li>- &lsquo;<samp>msp_s</samp>&rsquo;, the main stack pointer register (secure state).  It is 32 bits
in size with type &lsquo;<samp>data_ptr</samp>&rsquo;.
</li><li>- &lsquo;<samp>psp_s</samp>&rsquo;, the process stack pointer register (secure state).  It is 32 bits
in size with type &lsquo;<samp>data_ptr</samp>&rsquo;.
</li></ul>

<p>When <small>GDB</small> sees this feature, it will attempt to track the values of
all 4 stack pointers across secure state transitions, potentially improving
unwinding when applications switch between security states.
</p>
<p>Extra registers are allowed in this feature, but they will not affect
<small>GDB</small>.
</p>
<span id="TLS-registers-feature"></span><h4 class="subsubsection">G.5.3.11 TLS registers feature</h4>

<p>The optional &lsquo;<samp>org.gnu.gdb.arm.tls</samp>&rsquo; feature contains TLS registers.
</p>
<p>Currently it contains the following:
</p>
<ul class="no-bullet">
<li>- &lsquo;<samp>tpidruro</samp>&rsquo;, the user read-only thread id register.  It is 32 bits in size
and has type &lsquo;<samp>data_ptr</samp>&rsquo;.
</li></ul>

<p>At the moment <small>GDB</small> looks for this feature, but doesn&rsquo;t do anything
with it other than displaying it.
</p>
<p>Extra registers are allowed in this feature, but they will not affect
<small>GDB</small>.
